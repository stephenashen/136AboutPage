# Hello there! 
> I’m Stephen Shen, a third year Computer Science major studying at UCSD.

## Interests
> Here are some things that I like to do.
- Sports -- I played hockey for 11 years of my life and I've been skating for 13 years of my life. I also played a variety of sports growing up like football, basketball, and soccer, so I usually really like to be out and about.

## Work/Internship Experiences
> Here's some of the things that I have worked on/accomplished over the past few years.
- Scripps Institution of Oceanography & SDSU -- I	Developed Python code libraries for climate data analysis and visualization (computing and plotting) on large climate NOAA data sets over a wide range of time and geological regions. 
- Machine Learning Research Intern --	I researched and presented on the fundamentals of Machine Learning including appropriately fitting models to data. Using this knowledge, I then assisted in a graduate level project by utilizing relevant statistical methods to build, train, and test a machine learning model that would predict El Niño water temperatures based off past data.

## Tools and technologies
> Skills I've accumulated so far
- Languages I'm proficient at -- Java, C++, Python
- Languages I have basic experience in -- R, C, C#, System Verilog, MATLAB
- Technical Classes -- Advanced Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, Theory of Computation, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Operating Systems, Software Engineering – incl. Agile Development, Computer Organization & Systems Programming
